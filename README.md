## Orchids
When sunlight is less than 7 hours in a day, production will go down by 4% for every 10 minutes.
When the humidity levels are outside the range of 60-80%, production will fall 2% for every 5% humidity change.

In the submission logs, sunlight is decreasing throughout the duration of the trading period. This may be beacuse
the submission logs only calculate a small fraction of the trading period (only having 100,000 timesteps instead of 1M)
